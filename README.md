I'm a high school student who lives in New Zealand. I'm learning to code in more languages other than HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I love making and designing websites with HTML and CSS.

For my programming projects, I usually only upload to GitHub once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories
